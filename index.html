            French fries (North American English), chips (British English),[1] fries,[2] finger chips (Indian English),[3] 
            or French-fried potatoes are batonnet or allumette-cut deep-fried potatoes. In the United States and most of Canada, 
            the term fries refers to all dishes of fried elongated pieces of potatoes, while in the United Kingdom, Australia, 
            South Africa (rarely), Ireland and New Zealand, thinly cut fried potatoes are sometimes called shoestring fries or 
            skinny fries to distinguish them from the thicker-cut chips.
            French fries are served hot, either soft or crispy, and are generally eaten as part of lunch or dinner or by 
            themselves as a snack, and they commonly appear on the menus of diners, fast food restaurants, pubs, and bars. 
            Fries in America are generally salted and are almost always served with ketchup, but in many countries they have other 
            condiments or toppings, like vinegar, mayonnaise, or other local specialties. Fries can be topped more heavily, as in
             the dishes of poutine and chili cheese fries.
             French fries can be made from sweet potatoes instead of potatoes. A baked variant of the French fry ("oven chips") 
             uses less or even no oil.[4]

            Ice cream (derived from earlier iced cream or cream ice[1]) is a sweetened frozen 
            food typically eaten as a snack or dessert. It is usually made from dairy products, 
            such as milk and cream, and often combined with fruits or other ingredients and flavors. 
            It is typically sweetened with sugar or sugar substitutes. Typically, flavourings and colourings 
            are added in addition to stabilizers. The mixture is stirred to incorporate air spaces and cooled below the 
            freezing point of water to prevent detectable ice crystals from forming. The result is a smooth, semi-solid foam 
            that is solid at very low temperatures (< 2 °C or 35 °F). It becomes more malleable as its temperature increases.
            The meaning of the phrase "ice cream" varies from one country to another. Phrases such as "frozen custard", "frozen
             yogurt", "sorbet", "gelato" and others are used to distinguish different varieties and styles. In some countries, 
             such as the United States, the phrase "ice cream" applies only to a specific variety, and most governments regulate 
             the commercial use of the various terms according to the relative quantities of the main ingredients, notably the 
             amount of cream.[2] Products that do not meet the criteria to be called ice cream are labelled "frozen dairy dessert" 
             instead.[3] In other countries, such as Italy and Argentina, one word is used for all variants. Analogues made from 
             dairy alternatives, such as goat's or sheep's milk, or milk substitutes (e.g., soy milk or tofu), are available for
              those who are lactose intolerant, allergic to dairy protein, or vegan.
